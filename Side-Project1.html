														<h2>Document Clustering</h2>
														<p>leverages unsupervised machine learning techniques</p>
													</header>
													<p>
														Ever feel like you’re spending way too long sorting PDFs by how they look? Maybe you’re trying to organize invoices,
									 					reports, or forms with similar layouts but different content. Doing this manually, comparing each document by eye, 
									 					can get time-consuming and frustrating.
														With this automated clustering solution, this process gets way easier. Picture a stack of PDFs, like invoices from various 
														vendors—all with similar layouts. Instead of sorting each one by hand, This machine learning model groups them quickly by layout 
														patterns, saving you loads of time and effort.

															<h3>Why it Matters?</h3>
														</header>
														<p>
															When I was working with the Nebula team at Petronas Digital, one task in developing a text extractor model 
															was grouping documents based on their layout or pattern. The reason for this is that the text extractor model 
															needed to be trained by layout or pattern. Usually, our client would send me a large batch of PDFs, and I had 
															to sort them manually by eye. Although it wasn’t a hard task, it was tedious and time-consuming. Many machine 
															learning models can group documents, but they usually do it by content—like grouping documents that talk about 
															animals or food. This didn’t help with my need to group by layout. So, I decided to build a custom model that 
															could group documents by their structure instead of their content, which made the process much faster and easier.

															<h3>Approach</h3>
														</header>
															<p>To summarize the three key components for this model:</p>
															<ol>
																<li>
																	<strong>Text Extraction with Coordinates:</strong> Extracts text from each document along with its spatial coordinates, allowing layout-based clustering.
																</li>
																<li>
																	<strong>Defining the K Value Using the Elbow Technique:</strong> Uses the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters (<code>K</code>) by analyzing within-cluster variance to ensure effective grouping.
																</li>
																<li>
																	<strong>Euclidean Distance Similarity for Clustering:</strong> Measures the similarity between documents based on Euclidean distance, grouping documents that have close spatial characteristics into the same cluster.
																</li>
															</ol>
															<p>These keys form the foundation for accurately clustering documents based on layout patterns rather than content.</p>
